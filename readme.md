# Gunpath generator for Cyberpunk Red

This script automates the process of the gunpath system from the Cyberpunk Red DLC [Toggle's Temple](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RTG-CPR-DLC-TogglesTemplev1.1.pdf)

## To-Do

- Add guide function to script to allow user to chose options as the process runs.
    - This requires function to get unique entries from weighted rolling tables.
- "Madlibs" type function for gun names.
